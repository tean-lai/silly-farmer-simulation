# silly-farmer-simulation
This is a project that I made as one of my projects for AP Computer Science Principles, which is a course I took when I was a freshman in high school. The assignment was to make a simulation of our own choice.

I worked with my good friend Jeffrey Tan on this project, and we were really into the game Stardew Valley at the time, which is a farming game. In that game, you can really farm however you wish, so we wanted to make a simulation to see what kind of farming mindset would make the most money.
